									<h2>The Beginning</h2>
									<h1>Why IT?</h1>
							<p>I started out in IT through computer games at a young age, when I joined the military they asked me what interests I had and the only thing I could think of was computers. <p>
							<p>8 years later and I haven’t looked back. I find the ever changing world of IT interesting, there are so many things that make up IT that if you ever get bored of one you can go down another pathway. The information is readily available and the pathways are limitless. </p>

									<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
									<p>What lead me to RMIT is that I needed the degree to back my experience within the field, studying online was the only option for me as I work full time. </p>
									</p>Searching through Open Universities Australia lead me to a few universities however RMIT stood out over the rest with the reviews and course structure.  </p>
									<p>I plan to learn most about programming skills as that is where I am weakest and as it is an online degree I would think it was easier to facilitate. <p>

									<h2>Dream Job</h2>
									<h1>Cloud Engineer (AWS)</h1>
							<p>Link: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50113084?type=standout#searchRequestToken=2e6079a2-72a7-4b4a-97f1-2d2a1c44ec76">Job Description</a>
							<p><img src="images/job.png" alt="Italian Trulli"> </p>
							<p> Cloud Engineers are responsible for the underlying infrastructure that companies run off. Well cloud engineer is a vague term however the path I would go down would be infrastructure as a service. They would be responsible but not limited to building the infrastructure on cloud service providers e.g. AWS or Azure, monitoring and implementing upgrades as needed. 
This career path appeals to me as it is in high demand and it uses my knowledge from on prem servers and how it all works and brings in new technology for me to continue to grow my knowledge. 
</p>
							<p>Depending on the cloud service that you go with would depend on the certification/experience you will need. 
Sticking with Azure as it has the easiest pathway to follow however the others would be very similar and transitioning between the others wouldn’t be as bad once you know the common terms. 
Qualifications needed:
AZ-900 (optional) Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator
From there I could progress into either security or devops. I would also need to develop more skills with particular programming to help automation.
 </p>
							<p> I do not have any actual qualifications however I have done CCNA (networking), MSCA equivalent (Server-infrastructure) and have also used AWS and Azure however not extensively. 
I have over 8 years of experience with troubleshooting multiple on prem environments remotely and on-site. 
</p>
							<p>Whilst finishing my degree, I will complete Azure Fundamentals as this should be fairly easy. 
Then with that I plan to then work slowly through the Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate Certificate and then apply for a position within my work place to get the experience for a cloud engineer working with people already in the field. 
If I have time I will finish off getting my MSCA and can also follow that and get security certifications which would also help the cloud environments.

									<h2>Personality Tests</h2>
									<h1>Results</h1>
							<p> Myer-Briggs</p>
							<p> Virtuoso</p>
							<p> Virtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity</p>
							<p><img src="images/myer.png" alt="Italian Trulli">  </p>
							<p> Online Learning Test</p>
							<p> Auditory: 30%
								Visual: 35%
								Tactile: 35%</p>
							<p> You are a Visual/Tactile learner! </p>
							<p> The Big Five Personality Test</p>
							<p>Openness 52% Conscientiousness 52% Extraversion 27% </p>
								<p>Agreeableness 77% Neuroticism 23%</p>
								<h2>Evaluation of results</h2>
								<p> All 3 tests results show me that I learn by doing and seeing. I am a visual learner and work well in high stress situations. I would rather listen to someones problems and agree with their situations then to tell people of my own issues. </p>
								<p>In a team environment these results show that I would influence a team by inputting points when needed, I wouldn’t lead a team discussion however if things became heated I would be able to step in and take charge. </p>
								<p>When forming a team you want differing abilities and personalities so to come up with different ideas. With this in mind I would try to find an extrovert to round out my introvert tendencies. Also would need someone who was a quick thinker. </p>
								<p>I would say the validity of these results are accurate, they all ask similar questions and all 3 results came back with similar answers. Some parts were suprising to me however I still think are valid. </p>

									<h2>G-Wallet</h2>
									<h1>Everything gaming in one tiny space</h1>
							<p>



<p style="color:Tomato;" style="font-size:400%%;">Overview</p>
This will be a web application/ desktop and mobile application that syncs all gaming data across all devices. 
No longer play the games you like by yourself or lose account details over time. 
<p>Buy a new computer but forget what games you had installed, create cloud backups of the games easily with this one portal.
One app connects all your gaming needs. With alerts that tell you real time when your favourite friends are on from around the globe. 
AI to tell you about games that you may enjoy. 
Character creation and enhancements, rewards for rating gamers, games and streamers. </p>


<p style="color:Tomato;">Motivation</p>
<p>
Working a full-time job, studying at university and having commitments with friends and family makes time for gaming slim for me. The motivation for this is to have a one stop shop for everything gaming. 
I believe gamers are social people and with the ever-increasing younger population being more inclined to gaming and not just gender or age specific anymore there needs to be an application that has everything you can ask for in terms of gaming inside it.
At my age I don’t meet that many people, the people I do meet rarely have the same hobbies. With this app you can find like minded people to laugh and bond with. </p>





<p style="color:Tomato;">Description</p>
<p>
G-Wallet features will include the following; <p>
Link accounts – the ability to grab all account data using API’s, it will securely store all of your gaming accounts across all of your devices in one location. No longer will you forget your username, or the email associated to it. You will just need to remember one ultimate password which is on an enforced update of 3 months to keep it secure. 
<p>
Shortcuts – The wallet will hold all shortcuts for every game you have, simply open the application on your gaming device and choose which game you would like to play, in the background it will open the application and sign in. It will then display the game ready to play. Option to macro “Start particular game mode for quick play”, i.e. When I open quick play version of Call of Duty, start search for deathmatch, with these map options. 
<p>
Automatic Server Selection – based on your ping from the application you are accessing at the time it will ensure the quickest path possible. 
<p>
Parental Control – Parents can now monitor the games that the children play and can confirm downloads from children under a age. They can also limit what is in the options for them to play as well as monitor all API chat live from one place.
<p>
Friend Finder – The application will use AI technology to suggest like minded people as well as games it thinks you would be interested in. You can also manually search for friends and rate the ones you have played with (One-word comments only as to not detract from user’s ability to find suitable friends). You will have the ability to search by gender, age, game type etc. 
<p>Will add in features like adult verification for children under the age of 18. i.e. consent forms etc. <p>
Health Timer – will have an interactive health timer for users’ profile; you can see how many hours you have spent at your chair; it will lock users out for 5 – 10 minutes to stretch and get water. 
<p>You can input how much water you have, and it will show you a water meter. Perhaps it could use a character which you can develop, and it gets weak if you don’t have the right number of breaks or water intake etc. 
It will also promote healthy eating habits with short videos on tips for cooking as well as links to physical training tips. <p>
<p>There will also link your gaming habits and other variables to streamers that it would think you would like through twitch or YouTube. <p>
<p>This app could add a feature where it promotes socialising outside the home as well, be it catching up with new gamer friends in the area or local gaming cafes could advertise through the app. <p>
<p>You can also put in computer specs into the application and depending on the games it could have recommendations of compatible upgrades to make user experience more enjoyable. <p>
<p>It would also feature a plugin for chat services like discord so that you could chat on the go. </p>




<p style="color:Tomato;">Tools and Technologies </p>
<p>
Hardware
-	Cloud servers to host databases across the world 
-	Possible security key if needed for users</p>
<p>Software
-	Web application front end and back end to host across all platforms
-	APIs for all included data sets 
-	AI technology to learn behaviours and patterns
-	Chat bot for support
-	GPS location tracking software</p>



<p style="color:Tomato;">Skills Required</p>
 </p>
<p>
To get this started you would need to organize a team of IT professionals with the following backgrounds; <p>
-	Web development (front and backend)<p>
-	Software Engineer <p>
-	Either have someone who has a background in cloud technologies AWS or Azure<p>
-	Database administrator <p>
-	Security specialist<p>
-	Application developer <p>
<p>Expertise in the following systems;<p>
Database frameworks like Mongo DB), SMS services like Twilio, Mapping tools like Mapbox
Programming languages like Swift, Object C or Java.
You can also outsource a lot of these jobs to external companies to provide you all of this. 
Perhaps the easier option would be to use a SAAS (Software as a service) platform which will reduce the need for a few of the above-mentioned requirements. 
</p>



<p style="color:Tomato;">Outcome</p>
  <p>
There are similar applications already out there, depending on marketing and design and customer feedback will depend on whether the outcome will be successful. The user interface will need to be easy to use as well as highly functional. 
The impact this will have on the gaming community is that they will feel like they have more outlets for find likeminded people to socialise with and maybe make lasting friendships. 
It will help keep all your login details for gaming services i.e. blizzard, steam etc. and also solo games like league of legends in one place. 
It will also help parents track the usage time and who they chat to as well as how they behave in an online forum.
